# WeRateDogs
This repo contains the insights and visualizations produced from the exploratory data analysis done on the WeRateDogs twitter data .
The report explains the wrangling efforts exercised in this project. In carrying out this project, I gathered three(3) datasets for analysis. The datasets are; WeRateDogsâ„¢ Twitter Archive, Tweet image predictions and 
Twitter data from Twitter API.

WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. The account was started in 2015 by college student Matt Nelson. WeRateDogs asks people to send photos of their dogs, then tweets selected photos rating and a humorous comment. Dogs are rated on a scale of one to ten, but are invariably given ratings in excess of the maximum, such as "13/10". Popular posts are re-posted on Instagram and Facebook. In 2017, Nelson started a spin-off Twitter account, Thoughts of Dog. 


The wrangling process is divided into 3 major steps;
1.	Data Gathering
2.	Data Accessing
3.	Data Cleaning
